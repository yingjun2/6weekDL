## Week 3 - Recurrent Networks

- Watch the Sequence Models Specialization on Coursera, found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
- Watch my videos on recurrent networks, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwmddtPFWtA&t=4s), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdLUzrjnlr4), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zhrxE5PQgY&t=25s)
- Read Trask's blogpost on LSTM RNNs found [here](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/)
- Write out a simple RNN yourself (using no ML libraries)

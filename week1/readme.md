This is reading notes for week 1 (Feedforward Neural Networks and Backpropagation).

Tasks for this week as as follows:
- Read Part I of the Deep Learning Book found [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) 
- Use this cheat sheet to help understand any math notation, found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/40544016221)
- Watch [Build a Neural Net in 4 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ)
- Read [Neural Net in 11 lines](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/) 
- Type out the neural network code yourself in a text editor, compile, and run it locally (using no ML libraries)
- Watch [Backpropagation in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q555kfIFUCM)
